# DROP
Remove or Drooping specific rows &amp; columns

can anyone help me on the below 2 question on how to code it i have tried multiple ways but getting errors
 1. Analyze the date column and remove the entries if it has an incorrect timeline
 2. Draw scatter and hexbin plots for complaint concentration across Brooklyn
I have tired drop function but im only able to drop the column but not the incorrect entries
2nd one im getting the scatter & hexbin with matplotlib.pyplot library but unable to get the answer specific to above question.
